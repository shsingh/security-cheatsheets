A collection of useful cheatsheets for [cheat](https://github.com/chrisallenlane/cheat) that focuses on aiding security-type people with either security tools or popular UNIX programs.

## Requirements

- [cheat](https://github.com/chrisallenlane/cheat)

## Installation

- Somehow get this repository into your `~/.cheat` directory.

## Usage

Use this like you'd normally use `cheat`. For example, use `cheat ncat` to display the `ncat` cheatsheet.

## History

These security cheatsheets were a part of a project for the Ethical Hacking and Penetration Testing course offered at the University of Florida. Expanding on the default set of cheatsheets, the purpose of these cheatsheets are to aid penetration testers/CTF participants/security enthusiasts in remembering commands that are useful, but not frequently used. Most of the tools that will be covered have been included in our class and are available in [Kali Linux](http://www.kali.org).
